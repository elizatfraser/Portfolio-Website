            <p>The strategy for SWELL was created using the <span>double diamond design model,</span> which focuses on breaking up the design process into four stages; <span>Discover, Define, Design, and Deliver. </span>
              Like any process, this journey was not linear, and all stages held many iterations. This encouraged constant validation of our design decisions, which
              ensured our solutions kept the needs of the user at the forefront.

              and lows of what users were dealing with when wanting to head out for a surf.
              This research was where I was able to uncover key insights around current trends in market leading surfing apps, which helped inform my design approach.</p>

            <p>In order to create a tool that will be used, we first need to understand when, where and why it will be used. This will help to shape the very first design decisions, such as <span>mobile-first design, information architecture</span>
              and <span>navigation.</span></p>
            <p>These user journeys also ensured I was developing an app that answered the users’ needs, goals and motivations. I continued to cycle through a loop of <span>design, validate and iterate,</span> until I had identified the <span>pain
                points</span> within these user journeys and had developed <span>strategies</span> to overcome them. </p>

            <h4>Project challenges</h4>
            <p>SWELL was a <span>solo project,</span> which presented a set of challenges as I was responsible for the <span>full scope</span> without a team to support. </p>

            <p>This challenge became a huge <span>opportunity</span> for me to develop skills in areas that I may not have been exposed to in a larger group. </p>

            <p>I was able to balance the big picture while also concentrating on the smaller details of the design, and this also led me to <span>network</span> and <span>collaborate</span> with other designers when needed to ensure I did not develop
              tunnel vision in my direction. </p>

            <p>The user was always my source of validating my design decisions and through this process I believe I have been able to create a product that delivered solutions to the problems faced by the persona’s, Adam and Jess. </p>
            <h4>On a personal level</h4>
            <p>For myself, I enjoyed this build thoroughly. It taught me the value in listening to people, then advocating for their needs in design decisions. It taught me how to have patience with constant iterations and left me with a feeling of
              pride in what I have accomplished.</p>
