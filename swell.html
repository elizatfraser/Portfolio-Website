            <h3>Project challenges</h3>
            <p>SWELL was a <span>solo project,</span> which presented a set of challenges as I was responsible for the full scope without a team to support. </p>

            <p>This challenge became a huge opportunity for me to develop skills in areas that I may not have been exposed to in a larger group. </p>

            <p>I needed to balance the big picture of the experience of the user while also concentrating on the smaller details of the design, and this also led me to <span>network</span> and <span>collaborate</span> with other designers to ensure I
              was gathering feedback from all available avenues</p>

                Or could it be understanding how to pick the best time based on the weather?</span></p>
            <p>I set out to understand surfers (aspiring and pro!), so I could create a product that helped make surfing a better and easier experience for them.

        <div class="column left-text col-lg-6 no-h4">
          <p>The strategy for SWELL was created using the <span>double diamond design model,</span> which focuses on breaking up the design process into four stages; <span>Discover, Define, Design, and Deliver. </span></p>
          <p>Like any process, this journey was not linear, and all stages held many iterations. This encouraged constant validation of our design decisions, which
            ensured our solutions kept the needs of the user at the forefront.
          </p>
          <p> Using the double diamond model, I approached the process with a clear plan for success. </p>

            <p>I experienced first hand the highs

            <p>
              This research was where I was able to uncover key insights around current trends in market leading surfing apps, which helped inform my design approach.</p>

          <div class="column left-text col-lg-6">
            <p>However, as I learnt very quickly, designing digital products is vastly different. Each screen that a user will view my app on has variables. Then, the environment in which they use it has even more variables. </p>
            <p> Will they be able to see the text if the contrast in colours can't compete with a sunny day?</p>
            <p>I soon realised that in graphic design being able to control the size of a page, the colour contrast and the final printed design was a luxury. </p>
            <p>So while I couldn't control every pixel - I could carefully consider how it would be viewed. I could design for multiple screen sizes, I could design for accessibility and above everything, I could design for the user.
