              Liquor King New Zealand wanted to launch a campaign that would be disruptive and engaging for their consumers.
            </p>
            <p>
              They had the Lion NZ internal design team pitch for the idea, as well as an external agency. My concept "Taste the Interesting" was based on taking ingredients that may not normally seem to go together, and combine them to create
              something new and exciting.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="column left-text col-lg-6">
            <p>
              My concept was chosen as the succesful idea that would be taken into development, and I was then given the task of refining the initial concept into what would become a full campaign.
            </p>

              The collateral that needed to be created included 3x sizes of lundia displays, a spinning wheel of cocktail creations, posters, cocktail recipe menus, brochures and a social campaign.
            </p>
            <p>
              Working as the solo designer on this project, I worked alongside the Lion beer ambassador to create six cocktail recipes which would feature on the spinning wheel and used throughout the campaign.
            </p>

              My concept was chosen as the succesful idea that would be taken into development, and I was then given the task of refining the initial concept into what would become a full campaign.

              The result was a design that immediately caught eyes in the centre of the store. It was bright, bold and interactive.
            </p>
            <p>
              The campaign ran for two months in Liquor King stores and performed succesfully.
